Project Description: Attendance Management System for Lecturers and Faculty Interns

Overview:
This 'Attendance Management System for Lecturers and Faculty Interns' project aims to develop a comprehensive Attendance Management System for lecturers and faculty interns to efficiently track student attendance in classes. This system will provide a user-friendly interface for recording attendance, maintaining a detailed record of attendance dates, and automating notifications for student absenteeism.

Features:
 
User Roles:
	Lecturer: Can create classes, add students, take attendance (keenly recording dates), and view attendance records.
Faculty Intern: Can assist in taking attendance under the supervision of the lecturer.

	Attendance Recording:
Lecturers and interns can mark student attendance for each class session.
The system will store attendance data securely and maintain a history of all attendance dates.

	Automated Notifications:
If a student misses class for three consecutive days, the system will automatically send notifications to the student and the lecturer.
Notifications will serve as alerts for absenteeism, prompting necessary actions to be taken.

	Reporting and Analytics:
Generate reports on student attendance patterns, trends, and overall class attendance rates.
Analyze data to identify students with frequent absences for intervention.

	User-Friendly Interface:
Intuitive design for easy navigation and efficient attendance management.
Responsive layout for access on various devices.


Benefits:
Streamlined attendance tracking process for lecturers and interns.

Future Enhancements:
Machine learning algorithms for predictive attendance analysis.
Mobile application development for on-the-go attendance management.
